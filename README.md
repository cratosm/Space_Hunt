# Space Hunt
Space Hunt is a game of discovery that plunges you into a universe with different atmospheres. You will embody a character, needing an antidote in order to heal himself. To do this, you will have to explore worlds with the help of portals and let your curiosity tempt you.
## History of Space Hunt
Originally Space Hunt is a one-weekend project for an Epitech Jam. The objective was to discover a new technology and thus realize a project on the theme of space.
Dissatisfied with the finality of our project, we decided to pursue it and by this way deepen our knowledge of the Godot video game engine and its language the Godot Script.
